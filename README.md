## Phase2 Deliverable

**S3 Data Storage:**
1. Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a highly scalable and secure object storage solution which is Amazon S3 (Simple Storage solution). We make use of this service to store our dataset before preprocessing it and applying transformations on the same.
2. S3 is advantageous as it lets you store and access any volume of data at any time, it's the perfect option for hosting big datasets, including data about products.
3. S3 is used  to group data into buckets, which are named within the S3 namespace and are globally unique, the link that stores our dataset is s3://pre-post-purchase-questions/.
4.This is the link we use as input to perform the next steps as documented below.
5.S3 is flexible for a product study project since it can store a variety of data kinds, including text files, photos, and metadata.
6. It allows you to regulate who can access your information with fine-grained access controls.
7. Versioning and logging are two capabilities that S3 offers that help you keep track of changes and keep an eye on who has access to your dataset over time.
8. S3 objects may be retrieved using a distinct URL, which makes it easier to integrate them with analytic software and machine learning techniques.

**Data Exploration:**

To draw meaningful insights from the dataset for data exploration we have used Athena for querying the data.

*Count Total Records:*
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM prepostquestionsdb.PrePostQuestions;

*Count Questions Per Product:*
SELECT asin, COUNT(question) AS total_questions FROM prepostquestionsdb.PrePostQuestions GROUP BY asin;

**Data Transformations - AWS Glue**

1. Number of questions for each product: Understanding the distribution of questions for each product is crucial for assessing user engagement and product popularity. By analyzing the dataset, we can determine the number of questions associated with each unique product, identified by its ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number). This information provides valuable insights into user interest and interaction levels for individual products. Products with a higher number of questions may indicate greater user engagement, potential issues, or areas that require additional support or attention. This analysis aids product managers and customer support teams in tailoring their strategies to address specific product-related concerns effectively.

2. General processing time for the entire system: Assessing the general processing time for the entire system is essential for evaluating the efficiency of the dataset processing pipeline or system. This metric represents the time taken to perform data processing tasks, including data loading, cleaning, transformation, and any other relevant operations. Monitoring and optimizing the general processing time contribute to overall system performance. A shorter processing time enhances the responsiveness of the system, ensuring timely analysis and insights. System administrators and developers can use this information to identify bottlenecks, streamline processes, and improve the overall efficiency of the data processing system.

3. Processing time for each item: Analyzing the processing time for each item provides a granular view of the system's performance, offering insights into the efficiency of operations specific to individual products. By measuring the time it takes to process questions related to each item, system administrators can identify potential outliers, bottlenecks, or areas of improvement. Variations in processing time among different items may highlight specific challenges or opportunities for optimization. This information is instrumental in fine-tuning the system's capabilities, ensuring that it can handle varying workloads and maintain consistent performance across different products. Additionally, it aids in resource allocation and optimization efforts to enhance the overall processing efficiency for each item in the dataset.

**Visualizations**
1. Question Count vs. ASIN: - This chart will demonstrate how user-generated questions are distributed among various ASINs (Amazon Standard Identification Numbers).
 Every product on Amazon is individually identified by its ASIN, which makes it possible to analyze consumer activity and interest in great detail.
   - By using the bar or line charts provided by Amazon QuickSight, you can quickly spot patterns and determine which products are generating the most interest from users or inquiries.

2. Product ASIN vs. Average Hours Diff:
 The goal of this visualization is to show, for each product ASIN, the average time interval between successive user questions.
 It offers information about how frequently and consistently users engage with content over time.
-Scatter plots and line charts from Amazon QuickSight are useful tools for visualizing this temporal component and identifying products that users are consistently or occasionally interested in.

3. ASIN vs. Label Distribution:
 This visualization seeks to identify patterns in the way users classify products based on their inquiries by focusing on the distribution of user-assigned labels or categories to products.
By providing insightful information about consumer preferences and perceptions, this visualization can aid in the understanding of the perceived benefits or features of different goods.
